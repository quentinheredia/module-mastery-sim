    "question": "We have a system in which 3 types of clients are arriving according to a Poisson process with rate λ (i.e., each type arrives with rate λ). Clients of type 1 always enter. Type 2 clients only enter if there are less than 3 clients in the system. Type 3 clients only enter if there are less than 2 clients in the system. The system has 2 servers with exponential service rate μ each. Total capacity is 4.",
